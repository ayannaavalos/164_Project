# 164_Project

In this repo, we will upload both projects and datasets for our Machine Learning models. One model uses a IoT (Internet of Things) network traffic dataset and 
the other uses pictures of possible breast cancer tumours. Both models are classification models, with two different types of modeling for each dataset.

For our IoT dataset we use Logistic Regression for classification and a Multilayer Perceptron. For our breast cancer dataset we use Logistic Regression and 
K-Nearest Neighbors classifier. In our report we will discuss the pros, cons, results, and related works for each model.
